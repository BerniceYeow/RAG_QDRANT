# Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Qdrant database

### The Flow

### Step 1 - Imports and Client Setup:
Necessary libraries for Qdrant interaction (qdrant_client), embedding generation (fastembed), data manipulation (pandas, numpy), and progress bar (tqdm) are imported.
Qdrant client is initialized with URL, API key, and timeout settings.


### Step 2 - Embedding Generation Function (generate_points_from_dataframe):

This function processes the training DataFrame (df) to generate PointStructs for Qdrant.
It iterates through the DataFrame in batches (batch_size) to prevent memory issues.
Within each batch, questions are embedded using the embedding_model.embed function.
A temporary DataFrame (temp_df) is created to combine embeddings with existing data (question, title, context, is_impossible, answers).
The progress_apply method is used to generate PointStructs for each row, including ID, embedding vector, and payload (containing question, title, context, is_impossible flag, and answers).


### Step 3 - Uploading Embeddings to Qdrant:

The generated PointStructs (points) are uploaded to Qdrant using the upsert method with wait=True to ensure completion.
This step might require configuration specific to your Qdrant setup. Refer to the Qdrant documentation for detailed instructions.

Pros:

Efficient Retrieval: Qdrant provides fast vector similarity search, enabling quick retrieval of relevant context for few-shot learning.
Scalability: Qdrant can handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale language models.
Flexibility: Qdrant allows for various filtering and search options, providing flexibility in query refinement.

Cons:

Computational Cost: Embedding generation can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
Storage Overhead: Storing embeddings in Qdrant requires additional storage space.
Dependency on Qdrant: The model's performance relies on the efficient functioning of Qdrant.

### Step 4 - Few-Shot Prompt Generation Function (get_few_shot_prompt):

This function takes a row from the DataFrame (row) and creates a prompt for fine-tuning with few-shot learning.
It extracts the question (query) and context (row_context) from the row.
The question is embedded using embedding_model.embed.
A fixed number (num_of_qa_to_retrieve) of similar questions are retrieved from Qdrant using two separate queries:
Query 1: Searches for questions with answers present in the context (query_filter is likely set to filter for rows where is_impossible is False).
Query 2: Searches for questions where the answer is impossible ("I don't know") (query_filter is likely set to filter for rows where is_impossible is True).
The retrieved questions are used to construct the prompt (details of prompt construction are not provided in the given code).


Pros:

Improved Model Performance: Few-shot learning can significantly enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
Tailored Prompts: Qdrant enables the retrieval of highly relevant context, leading to more effective prompts.
Reduced Overfitting: By providing diverse examples, few-shot learning can help mitigate overfitting.

Cons:

Increased Complexity: The process of generating few-shot prompts involves additional steps and considerations.
Dependency on Qdrant: The model's performance relies on the accuracy of Qdrant's search results.
Computational Overhead: Retrieving and processing similar examples adds computational cost.

### Step 5 - Fine-Tuning and Evaluation:

The prompt generated by get_few_shot_prompt would be used to fine-tune the OpenAI model.
The fine-tuned model would then be evaluated on the validation set, potentially using the same prompting technique for consistency.

Pros:

Customized Model: Fine-tuning allows the model to be tailored to specific tasks and domains.
Improved Performance: Fine-tuning can lead to significant performance gains, especially for specific tasks.
Adaptability: The model can adapt to new data and evolving requirements.
Cons:

Computational Cost: Fine-tuning requires significant computational resources, especially for large models and datasets.
Time-Consuming: The fine-tuning process can be time-consuming, particularly for large models and datasets.
Potential Overfitting: Overfitting can occur if the model is trained on a limited dataset or for too long.

###Reasoning for the Evaluation Metrics
This code defines an Evaluator class for evaluating a question-answering model. The evaluation focuses on two key scenarios:

1. Answer Expected: When the model should provide an answer to the question.
2. "I don't know" Expected: When the model should indicate that it lacks sufficient information to answer the question.

The evaluation metrics used are:

Answered Correctly: Percentage of questions where the model's answer matches one of the provided answers.
Skipped: Percentage of questions where the model responded with "I don't know" although an answer was expected.
Wrong Answer: Percentage of questions where the model provided an incorrect answer.
Hallucination: Percentage of questions where the model responded with an answer when it should have said "I don't know."
✅ I don't know: Percentage of questions where the model correctly responded with "I don't know" when an answer was not possible.
These metrics assess the model's ability to:

Accuracy: Measure how often the model provides correct answers when expected.
Completeness: Evaluate how often the model acknowledges its limitations by saying "I don't know" when appropriate.
Honesty: Assess whether the model avoids making up answers when it lacks knowledge.
Summary of Evaluation Results
The Evaluator class provides two main functionalities:

evaluate_model: This function takes an answer column name (e.g., "generated_answer") and calculates the evaluation metrics for each scenario ("answer_expected" and "idk_expected"). It returns two dictionaries, one for each scenario, containing the percentages for each category (e.g., "✅ Answered Correctly", "❎ Skipped").
print_eval: This function compares the performance of two models (baseline and fine-tuned) on the same data. It uses evaluate_model to get the metrics for both models and then merges them into a DataFrame for easier comparison.
plot_model_comparison: This function creates a bar chart to visualize the evaluation results for a specific scenario ("answer_expected" or "idk_expected"). It uses Seaborn for plotting and allows customization of labels and titles.
Pros and Cons of the Evaluation Metrics
Pros:

Simple and interpretable: The chosen metrics are easy to understand and directly relevant to the desired model behavior.
Captures key aspects: They assess both accuracy and completeness, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
Identifies weaknesses: Metrics like "Hallucination" and "Skipped" can pinpoint areas for improvement.
Cons:

Limited scope: These metrics may not capture all aspects of a question-answering system, such as answer quality or factual correctness beyond matching provided answers.
Sensitivity to data: The evaluation may heavily depend on the quality and format of the training data.
Potential for bias: The definition of "correct" answer depends on the provided ones, which may not always be exhaustive.
Overall, the chosen evaluation metrics offer a good starting point for assessing a question-answering model. While they are simple and interpretable, it's important to consider their limitations and combine them with other evaluation methods for a more complete understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. This will be the future work that I will be focusing on.

### Overall, the combined approach of embedding generation, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning offers a powerful framework for improving the performance of language models. However, it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and computational costs involved.

Additional Considerations:

Data Quality: The quality of the training data is crucial for the success of fine-tuning.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model.
Model Selection: Choosing the right base model can also influence the final performance.
